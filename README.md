## Hey!ðŸ‘‹ I'm Niall!
I'm a 16 year old aspiring Game Developer who is currently a student at college studying Video Game Design. I am an individual game developer in my freetime and have completed a few projects and published them for the public to see! My first ever project was made in Godot 3.5, this is <b>Super Purpl's Platformer</b> which is a 2D platformer <i>(dispite the name)</i> that is heavily inspired by Nintendo's one and only <b>"Super Mario Bros."</b> Super Purpl's Platformer is not being developed anymore because I have made it the best it can be, but there will be many projects to come. My second project was a total remake of <b>"Super Mario World's"</b> physics using Godot 4. Although it is missing many crucial features, I believe it is very close to the original game. My third ever project was a remake of my favourite Story Horror game <a href= https://scpcbgame.com/>SCP: Containment Breach</a> using Unreal Engine 5. This was my first time ever developing in 3D and was my favourite project to make
